Servo-Tuning
Arduino Servo Position Feedback This repository contains the Arduino code for a project that modifies a standard high-torque RC servo to provide real-time analog position feedback. This allows you to read the servo's actual position, not just the position you commanded, which is essential for building smarter and more reliable robotics projects.
Standard RC servos operate on an "open-loop" system. You send a command, and you just have to trust that the servo reaches its target. By tapping into the servo's internal potentiometer, we can add a simple feedback wire that lets a microcontroller read the voltage and determine the precise current angle of the servo arm. This effectively converts the servo into a "closed-loop" system, enabling features like:

Stall Detection: Know if the servo is blocked or under too much load.

Smarter Robotics: Create more precise robotic arms and walkers.

Movement Recording: Record manual movements and play them back perfectly.

Increased Accuracy: Ensure your project components are exactly where they need to be.

Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: An Arduino UNO, Nano, or any similar board with at least one analog pin.

Servo Motor: A 20kg High-Torque Metal Gear Servo. It's important to use a servo that can be opened with screws.

Power Supply: An external 5V-6V power supply capable of providing at least 2A. ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do not power the 20kg servo directly from the Arduino's 5V pin, as this can damage your board.

Tools & Components:

Soldering Iron & Solder

A single, thin wire

Jumper wires

Breadboard

üîå Wiring
Before uploading the code, wire your components as follows. Remember to connect the grounds of your Arduino and the external power supply together.

Component	Connects To
Servo Signal	Arduino Digital Pin 9 (PWM)
Servo 5V	External Power Supply +5V/6V
Servo GND	External Power Supply GND
NEW Feedback Wire	Arduino Analog Pin A0
Arduino GND	External Power Supply GND (Common Ground)

Export to Sheets
A Fritzing diagram or a photo of your setup would be a great addition here.

üöÄ Setup & Calibration
This is the most critical part of the project. Every servo's internal potentiometer has a slightly different resistance range. You must calibrate the code to get accurate readings.

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Open in Arduino IDE: Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.

Initial Upload: Upload the code to your Arduino with the default calibration values:

C++

const int MIN_ANALOG_VALUE = 0;
const int MAX_ANALOG_VALUE = 1023;
Find Your Values:

Open the Serial Monitor and set the baud rate to 9600.

The servo will start sweeping. Watch the Actual: values printed to the monitor.

Note the smallest number you see when the servo is near 0 degrees.

Note the largest number you see when the servo is near 180 degrees.

Update and Final Upload:

Replace the MIN_ANALOG_VALUE and MAX_ANALOG_VALUE in the code with the two numbers you just found.

Upload the code one last time.

Your servo's position reading should now be highly accurate!

üí° Usage
With the calibrated code running, the Arduino will continuously sweep the servo from 0 to 180 degrees and back. The Serial Monitor will display a real-time comparison of the Target angle being sent to the servo and the Actual angle being read from the feedback wire.

You can now adapt this code for your own projects. Use the value from analogRead(SERVO_FEEDBACK_PIN) and the map() function to get reliable position data.
