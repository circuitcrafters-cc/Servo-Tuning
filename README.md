# Servo-Tuning
Arduino Servo Position Feedback This repository contains the Arduino code for a project that modifies a standard high-torque RC servo to provide real-time analog position feedback. This allows you to read the servo's actual position, not just the position you commanded, which is essential for building smarter and more reliable robotics projects.
